# Git & Github Guide

## Intro

Git is a version control system (VCS), with a few differentiating points:

1. It's fast
1. It's distributed (there's no need for a central server as every client posses the whole history for a repository)
1. Its rooted in the open source community and therefore integrates very well with other tools in our workflow

## Tutorial

There's a short and sweet tutorial by Codeacademy and Github called "Try Git".
It's assumed you'll complete it before proceeding any further.

## Push your first repo to Github

Assuming you're in a folder called `/my-repo` with the files you'd like to push.

```
# initialize a new git repository in /my-repo, so git will start tracking your files

$ git init

Initialized empty Git repository in /my-repo
```

Now you should do the equivalent step on Github servers.

Go to your profile on Github and create a new repository. 
You'll need to provide a name. It's advised you'll use the same name as your folder name (`my-repo`).
